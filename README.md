## ⚠️ 1. The Problem: Static Staging Bottleneck

Traditional MLOps teams relying on permanent staging environments face three critical pain points:

| Problem | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| 💸 **Financial Overhead** | GPU-backed SageMaker Endpoints running 24/7 inflate AWS bills by thousands of dollars monthly, even with zero idle traffic |
| 🌀 **Environment Drift** | Shared staging environments accumulate legacy configs, causing the classic *"works here but not in prod"* syndrome |
| ⚡ **Concurrency Issues** | Multiple Data Scientists pushing simultaneously overwrite each other's work on a single static endpoint, causing validation conflicts |

---

## 🏗️ 2. Solution Architecture

The core philosophy is **Infrastructure-on-Demand**. Every Pull Request gets its own isolated, full-fidelity "mini-production" stack.

### A. CI Automation — The Trigger

When a developer opens a PR, **GitHub Actions** orchestrates:

1. **Unit & Integration Tests** — Standard code quality checks run first.
2. **Containerization** — The model, inference script, and all dependencies are packaged into a Docker image.
3. **Registry Push** — The image is pushed to **Amazon ECR** with a unique tag (Git SHA) for absolute traceability.

### B. Dynamic Provisioning — The Infrastructure

**Terraform** acts as the single source of truth. On PR creation, `terraform apply` provisions:

- 🖥️ **Amazon SageMaker Endpoint** — Real-time inference using the newly pushed ECR image.
- 🔐 **API Gateway & Lambda** — Secure entry point handling authentication and request forwarding.
- 📊 **CloudWatch Logs** — Dedicated log groups for real-time inference debugging.

---

## 🔄 3. Operational Workflow & Deep Validation

Each ephemeral environment enables a high-fidelity feedback loop:

- **Functional Testing** — Reviewers test the API directly via `Postman` or `cURL`.
- **Schema Validation** — Input/output JSON structures are verified against production requirements.
- **Performance Benchmarking** — Dedicated endpoints allow load testing without impacting other developers.
- **Automated PR Comments** — The pipeline posts the temporary API URL back to the PR thread for one-click testing.

## 🧹 4. Automated Cleanup: The Cost-Killer

The most impactful feature is the **Auto-Destroy** mechanism.

| Step | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger** | GitHub Actions listens for `pull_request: closed` (covers both *Merged* and *Declined* PRs) |
| **Execution** | `terraform destroy` wipes all provisioned resources instantly |
| **Result** | Teams pay only for **compute minutes** used during the review — not idle hours |

> 💡 **Cost Reduction: Up to 90% savings on Staging OpEx.**

## 🛠️ 5. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | GitHub Actions | Triggers the pipeline and manages secrets |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Packages model + dependencies |
| **Registry** | Amazon ECR | Stores immutable, tagged model containers |
| **IaC** | Terraform | Manages the full lifecycle of AWS resources |
| **Inference** | AWS SageMaker | Hosts the model for real-time predictions |
| **Edge / API** | API Gateway + Lambda | Exposes the model securely to the outside world |
| **Logging** | Amazon CloudWatch | Monitors inference errors and latency |

---

## 🛡️ 6. Best Practices & Security

### IAM Least Privilege
Use **GitHub OIDC (OpenID Connect)** to authenticate with AWS. This eliminates the need to store long-lived access keys as GitHub secrets.

### Remote State Management
Store Terraform state in a remote **S3 bucket** with **DynamoDB locking** to prevent state corruption when multiple PRs are active simultaneously.

### Resource Tagging Strategy
Automatically tag all ephemeral resources for cost tracking and auditability:

```hcl
tags = {
  Environment = "Ephemeral"
  PR_Number   = var.pr_number
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  CreatedAt   = timestamp()
}
```

### Right-Sizing for PR Environments
Use small, cost-effective instances for PR environments. Reserve expensive GPUs for production only.

```hcl
# PR / Staging environment
instance_type = "ml.t2.medium"

# Production environment
instance_type = "ml.g4dn.xlarge"
```

## 🚀 7. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Terraform `>= 1.0`
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Docker

### Setup

**1. Configure GitHub OIDC for AWS**

```bash
# Create the OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com
```

**2. Initialize Terraform Remote Backend**

```bash
# Create S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state management
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=your-tfstate-bucket" \
  -backend-config="dynamodb_table=your-lock-table" \
  -backend-config="region=us-east-1"
```

**3. Configure GitHub Actions Workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ephemeral-env.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: github.event.action != 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/GitHubActionsRole
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve -var="pr_number=${{ github.event.number }}"

  destroy:
    if: github.event.action == 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Terraform Destroy
        run: terraform destroy -auto-approve -var="pr_number=${{ github.event.number }}"
```
